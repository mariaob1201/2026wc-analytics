"""Hierarchical Bayesian Poisson model of match scorelines (PyMC).

The model
=========
For a match between home team ``h`` and away team ``a`` we treat the goals each
side scores as Poisson counts whose (log) rates depend on an attack and a
defence ability per team::

    home_goals ~ Poisson(λ_home)
    away_goals ~ Poisson(λ_away)

    log λ_home = intercept + home_adv + att[h] - def[a]
    log λ_away = intercept            + att[a] - def[h]

Why hierarchical / "partial pooling"?
-------------------------------------
Each team's att/def is drawn from a shared distribution whose spread (σ) is
itself estimated. Teams with few matches are pulled toward the league average;
teams with many matches keep their own signal. This is the Bayesian cure for
small samples -- far more robust than fitting 48 independent strengths.

Where your player analytics enter
----------------------------------
The PRIOR MEAN of each team's attack ability is set to the ``prior_strength``
covariate engineered from player skills/longevity/social reach::

    att[t] ~ Normal(beta_prior * prior_strength[t], σ_att)

So before a single goal is observed, squads with stronger players are expected
to attack better -- and the match data then updates that belief. ``beta_prior``
is itself estimated, so the model decides how much to trust your covariate.

Identifiability
---------------
Attack/defence are only defined up to a constant, so we use zero-sum
("ZeroSumNormal") parameters -- the abilities are forced to average to zero,
with the overall scoring level absorbed by ``intercept``.
