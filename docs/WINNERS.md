## Method (simple by design)

- **Elo** is walked over all real results to today (recency- & WC-weighted K, goal-diff multiplier, host edge) — `models/elo.py`.
- **Goals**: Elo gap → two Poisson rates around a 1.35-goal baseline; the scoreline distribution gives 1X2.
- **Conditioning**: completed group games are fixed, so the scorecard reflects the actual standings — not a fresh re-roll.
- **LLM judge** (`--llm`) is an optional qualitative overlay on the next-day picks; see `models/llm_judge.py`.
