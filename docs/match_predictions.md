# WC 2026 — Match Predictions vs Reality, and Forecasts

_Model trained on pre-tournament data only (results to 2026-06-10 + FIFA squad prior). Backtest compares those out-of-sample forecasts to the actual scorelines; forecasts cover the next slate. Compiled 2026-06-28._

## Accuracy so far (out-of-sample)

- **Matches scored:** 72
- **Outcome hit-rate:** 62% (predicted W/D/L matched actual)
- **Mean probability on the actual outcome:** 0.45 · **Brier score:** 0.517 (lower is better)
- **Total-goals mean abs error:** 1.53 goals/match

> Read these as a small-sample sanity check (one matchday), not a verdict. Blowouts like Germany 7-1 and Canada 6-0 inflate the goals error — the model is calibrated to typical scorelines, not outliers.

## Notes on method

- **Goals model:** hierarchical Bayesian Poisson — each team's attack/defence fits the data, scorelines are posterior-predictive. See [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md).
- **Player data** (skillsets, seniority/age, semantic tier) feeds the model's prior and the context table above (FIFA dataset).
- **Public/sentiment sources** (ESPN, SI, social) enrich the Mexico deep-dive ([../data/processed/mexico_assessment.md]) and are wired to extend to other teams via the scouting + X-collector modules.
- **Limitation:** scores are independent Poisson and there is no strength-of-schedule term yet — see METHODOLOGY §10–11.
