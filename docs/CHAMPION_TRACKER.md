# 🏆 World Cup 2026 — Champion Tracker

_A living, state-aware forecast. Conditioned on the **40 matches played so far**: completed group games are held fixed; the rest of the tournament is simulated from a Bayesian goals model (squad-skill prior + current form + X/ESPN sentiment). Updated 2026-06-22._

## How to read this

1. **Next games** — predicted goals for the upcoming fixtures.
2. **The trophy** — each team's title probability, given everything that has already happened.

Both come from one model: goals are the primitive; the winner is a simulation over goals. See [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md).

## What feeds the prediction

- **Player skillsets** — squad ratings (pace/shooting/passing/…) and seniority form the model's prior, so squad quality shapes goals.
- **Current results** — the posterior is fit on matches through today and the simulation holds played games fixed.
- **Form + X/ESPN sentiment** — folded in as a small, capped goal-rate nudge (see `models/momentum.py`, `data/scouting.py`).
- **Charts:** `artifacts/champion_tracker.png` (title odds), `artifacts/forecast_probs.png`, `artifacts/calibration.png`.
