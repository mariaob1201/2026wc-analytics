## Keep working on it

- Re-run stages 13 → 14 after each matchday; calibration and MAE track model health over time.
- Sentiment is form-based for all teams + scouted for Mexico; add per-team scouting / X-collector output to enrich others.
- Tactical reads use coarse position buckets — see [METHODOLOGY.md](METHODOLOGY.md) for the upgrade path.
